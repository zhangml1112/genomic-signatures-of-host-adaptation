Model Creation Scripts
This repository provides scripts for building models using Random Forest and LASSO for feature selection. The scripts allow you to:

Random Forest Model: Build a Random Forest classifier for training and testing, evaluate model performance, and extract important features based on feature importance scores.

LASSO Regression: Perform LASSO regression for feature selection, identify important features based on non-zero coefficients, and visualize the results with Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and decision boundaries.

Both methods are useful for selecting key features in high-dimensional data, such as gene expression matrices, and can be applied to various classification tasks.
